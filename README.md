# Data_cleaning_prepare

Welcome to the Data Cleaning  repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive set of Python scripts and utilities to help researchers, analysts, and data enthusiasts tackle the essential task of data cleaning.

# Overview
Data cleaning is a critical step in the data analysis pipeline, as it ensures the quality and reliability of the data being used for subsequent analysis and decision-making. However, data cleaning can often be a time-consuming and tedious process, especially when dealing with large or complex datasets. This repository offers a collection of Python scripts and functions that address common data cleaning challenges, such as handling missing values, identifying and removing outliers, addressing data inconsistencies, and more. By leveraging these tools, users can streamline their data-cleaning workflows, freeing up more time for exploratory data analysis and generating meaningful insights.

# Features
The Data Cleaning includes the following key features:

Missing Value Imputation: Scripts for imputing missing values using various techniques, such as mean/median imputation, KNN imputation, and more.
Outlier Detection and Removal: Robust methods for identifying and removing outliers, including statistical approaches (z-score, IQR) and machine learning-based techniques.
Data Formatting and Normalization: Functions for standardizing data formats, handling date/time information, and normalizing numerical features.
Data duplication: Tools for identifying and removing duplicate records, based on user-specified criteria.
Data Validation: Scripts for validating data integrity, such as checking for data type consistency, enforcing business rules, and handling invalid entries.

# Getting Started
To get started with the Data Cleaning Toolkit, simply clone the repository and explore the provided scripts and examples. The repository includes a detailed README file, which provides instructions on how to set up the environment, use the available functions, and customize the tools to fit your specific data cleaning requirements.

We welcome contributions from the community, so feel free to submit pull requests, report issues, or suggest new features that can enhance the toolkit. Together, we can build a valuable resource for making data cleaning a more efficient and streamlined process.

Happy cleaning!
